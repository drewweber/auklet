Seen in the hundreds poking around in the shallows.,"All sightings by Tina and Matt in the Shorebird Cell at Hillman Marsh.  We visited the marsh twice, once in the morning and once in the evening.  Birds were much more pleatiful in the evening.    While watching the Egret we got an amazing look at a small Mink.  It hopped up right beside us in the grass with a mouse in its mouth.  After a few seconds it ran away out of sight into some taller grass."

Heard only.     We went about 200 m north of the camp site, to where the ridge flattens and then started going down the slope, without having heard any birds. We stopped at one point and played song. Not long after we got a response nearby, but it didn't stay vocalizing closely for long. We went a little further down the hill and heard the bird singing regularly to the south, so we stumbled our way south along the slope, trying to get closer to the bird which seemed to be happy singing from a single spot in some young vegetation at the bottom of some oak trees. Unfortunately, when we made our last push to get close to the bird, we all had trouble hanging on to the slope and crashed in position, which apparently flushed the bird, as I saw, out the corner of my eye, what I assumed was the Worm-eating Warbler dart off to the north. The bird was no longer vocalizing from where we had been hearing it. At this point, I think we'd all kind of had it with scrambling along the slope.",Expedition to find and document Worm-eating Warbler on the slope of Thatcher's Pinnacle.
